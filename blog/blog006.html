        <h1>Enhancing Molecular Stability Analysis</h1>
        
        <p>Today marked a significant step forward in our molecular stability analysis capabilities. We've expanded the Stability Indicators section to provide more detailed insights into the molecular composition and potential stability factors.</p>

        <div class="project-title">New Stability Indicators Implementation</div>
        
        <p>We've enhanced the Stability Indicators box with three key metrics that are crucial for understanding molecular stability:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Number of Atoms: Shows the total count of atoms in the current molecule</li>
            <li>Element Counts: Displays the distribution of different elements within the molecule</li>
            <li>Valence Electrons: Provides information about the valence electron configuration for each element</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These additions will help users better understand the factors that contribute to molecular stability. The right box has been relabeled to "Stability Indicators" to better reflect its enhanced functionality.</p>

        <p>This update represents a crucial step in our journey toward building a more comprehensive molecular stability prediction system. By providing these detailed metrics, we're laying the groundwork for more sophisticated analysis in future iterations.</p>
